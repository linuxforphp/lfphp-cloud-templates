# Continuous Delivery Templates for the LfPHP Cloud
The official repository of the LfPHP Cloud's Continuous Delivery templates.

Website: https://linuxforphp.com
Community: https://linuxforphp.net

These linuxforcomposer.json file templates will give you a starting
point to set up a Continuous Delivery pipeline for the LfPHP Cloud,
using the Linux for Composer Helper Library 
(https://packagist.org/packages/linuxforphp/linuxforcomposer).

The most basic template can be found in the 'standard' folder, and should
meet most requirements.

But, you can also add in some lines from other templates in order
to set up services like Redis, RabbitMQ, or MongoDB on your LfPHP
Cloud hosting account.

For more details, please read the README files contained with each
specific template.
