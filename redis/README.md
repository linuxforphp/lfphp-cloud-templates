#LfPHP Cloud - Redis Template - Linux for Composer

This example template helps you set up a LfPHP Cloud pipeline for
adding Redis support to your deployment.

* Enable the PHP extension for Redis,
* Enable the Redis server,
* Remove any unwanted services that start by default when using
other services than the standard LAMPP stack.

This template gives you code samples that you can mix in with
other templates, like the 'standard' template.
